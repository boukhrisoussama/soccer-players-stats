### Soccer Players Stats

"soccer-player-stats" is an application that gathers all the data concerning all the tunisian players around the world.
This application runs on an H2 database where are loaded all tunisian players that ever existed with the information and statistics about them.
The information is gathered from the [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) websites.
The statistics gathered for each player are the number of matches played, goals scored, assists made, yellow cards received, red cards received, and the number of minutes played.
The application is built with Spring Boot and uses angular for the front-end.

This project is hosted on a GitLab [soccer-players-stats](https://gitlab.com/boukhrisoussama/soccer-players-stats).
