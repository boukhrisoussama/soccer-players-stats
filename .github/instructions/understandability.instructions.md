- Be consistent. If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way.
- Use explanatory variables.
- Encapsulate boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are hard to keep track of. Put the processing for them in one place.
- Prefer dedicated value objects to primitive type.
- Avoid logical dependency. Don't write methods which works correctly depending on something else in the same class.
- Avoid negative conditionals.
